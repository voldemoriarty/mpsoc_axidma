The custom Linux kernel modules needed to use the AXI DMA library.

The userspace examples in these folders do not use the nicer library, and are 
only intended to demonstrate the module's raw API.

I've also copied and pasted whatever helpful files I had laying around, for the 
sake of understandablility.
